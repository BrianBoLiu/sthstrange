How it works.

Hashers:
* Input is (data, difficulty).
* len(data) = 39 (mod 64)
* difficulty is in hex.
* Returns nothing, or the data with a 16 byte nonce appended.

Put this sort of block into your ~/.ssh/config

Host gitcoin
  HostName elec5616.com
  User gitolite3
  IdentityFile ~/repos/honours/security/wargames/coin/edward
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  Ciphers arcfour
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist yes

Edit your username in miner.go

Then clone a repository:
git clone gitcoin:gitcoin gc
cp sha1 miner.go bumpledger.py gc
cd gc
go run miner.go


You can watch the redis server with
go run redis_record.go
